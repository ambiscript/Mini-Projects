# Find Pi to the Nth Digit
Develop a program that has the user enter a number. Your program should print out Pi up to that many decimal places. Try to keep a limit as to how far the program will go.

## Approach
1. Prompt the user for a number, and store in a variable x.
2. If x is greater than maximimum constant, return an error.
3. Cast pi to a string, and obtain the substring from index to 0 to index x.
